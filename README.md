# DEPRECATED

**Functionality related to the Merkle tree has been moved to the [relayer repo](https://github.com/holonym-foundation/holonym-relayer).**

# holonymd

holonymd is meant to run constantly alongside the rest of the Holonym stack to trigger updates at regular intervals. For example, it triggers Merkle tree finalization every few seconds.
